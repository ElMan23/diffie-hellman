# Diffie-Hellman

Diffie-Hellman algorithm implementation in Python.
For educational purpose only. The algorithm here implemented is not suitable for real-world encryption. 
In case you use it to encrypt your communication and it gets broken or decrypted, the responsibility for this is yours and yours only.

In a terminal launch the server:
```shell script
python server.py
```
In another terminal launch the client:
```shell script
python client.py
```
Both the processes should print the same shared secret.
